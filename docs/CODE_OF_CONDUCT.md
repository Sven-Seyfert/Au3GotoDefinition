# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## My adapted Code of Conduct

### My Goal

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, I try as much as I can, as project owner to making participation in my project and my community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### My Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

### My Responsibilities

As project maintainer I will clarify the standards of acceptable behavior and take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

I will remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me at info@sven-seyfert.de. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. I will be confidential with respect to the reporter of an incident.
